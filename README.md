### A Classifying Variational Autoencoder with Application to Polyphonic Music Generation

This is the implementation of the Classifying VAE and Classifying VAE+LSTM models, as described in [_A Classifying Variational Autoencoder with Application to Polyphonic Music Generation_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07050) by Jay A. Hennig, Akash Umakantha, and Ryan C. Williamson.

These models extend the standard VAE and VAE+LSTM to the case where there is a latent discrete category. In the case of music generation, for example, we may wish to infer the key of a song, so that we can generate notes that are consistent with that key. These discrete latents are modeled as a Logistic Normal distribution, so that random samples from this distribution can use the reparameterization trick during training.

__Code for these models (in Keras) can be found [here](https://github.com/mobeets/classifying-vae-lstm).__

Training data for the JSB Chorales and Piano-midi corpuses can be found in `data/input`. Songs have been transposed into C major or C minor (`*_Cs.pickle`), for comparison to previous work, or kept in their original keys (`*_all.pickle`).

### Generated music samples

Samples from the models trained on the JSB Chorales and Piano-midi corpuses, with songs in their original keys, can be found below, or in `data/samples`.

__JSB Chorales (all keys)__:

- VAE <br><audio src="data/samples/JSB10_VAE.wav" controls preload></audio>
- Classifying VAE (inferred key) <br><audio src="data/samples/JSB10_CL-VAE_infer.wav" controls preload></audio>
- VAE+LSTM <br><audio src="data/samples/JSB10_VRNN.wav" controls preload></audio>
- Classifying VAE+LSTM (inferred key) <br><audio src="data/samples/JSB10_CL-VRNN_infer.wav" controls preload></audio>

__Piano-midi (all keys)__:

- VAE <br><audio src="data/samples/PMall_VAE.wav" controls preload></audio>
- Classifying VAE (inferred key) <br><audio src="data/samples/PMall_CL-VAE_infer.wav" controls preload></audio>
- Classifying VAE (given key) <br><audio src="data/samples/PMall_CL-VAE_true.wav" controls preload></audio>

### Training new models

Example of training a Classifying VAE with 4 latent dimensions on JSB Chorales in two keys, and then generating a sample from this model:

```bash
$ python cl_vae/train.py run1 --use_x_prev --latent_dim 4 --train_file '../data/input/JSB Chorales_Cs.pickle'
$ python cl_vae/sample.py outfile --model_file ../data/models/run1.h5 --train_file '../data/input/JSB Chorales_Cs.pickle'
```
